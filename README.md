# PyTailment

A tool for curtailment detection and analysis on wind turbines.

This repository contains:
  - the PyTailment library (Containing the commented functions for the pipeline)
  - a small CLI to run the functions
  - a commented jupyter notebook walking the user through the process of curtailment detection and analysis, with numerous explanations and experiments with different settings and configurations
  - sample data folder
  - sample output folder (does not contain curtailment output, as it is too big. You will have to run it yourself ;) )
